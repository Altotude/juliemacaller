<h1>Juliana MacAller, coder, knitter, theologian</h1>
<p>Identifying just three books I enjoy is sort of like identifying three particular grains of sand on a beach. Yes, I am a book hoarder. So, instead, here are three books I'm currently reading.</p>
<ul>
<li>Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking by Susan Cain 
<li>Jesus: A Pilgrimage by James Martin, SJ
<li>Paragon Walk by Anne Perry
</ul>
<h2>A website with killer design</h2>
<p>I am <strong>so</strong> not a designer, but in my mind form and function work together. So my favorite site that gives me a ton of information without allowing the design to get in the way is <a href='http://www.ravelry.com'>Ravelry.</a>
<h2>Cutest animal pic ever</h2>
<p>How about this one?
